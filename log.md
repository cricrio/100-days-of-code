# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

+ I try to play with the Twitter API on the browser. I found that the Twitter API can't be query from the browser because the servers of Twitter doesn't implement CORS.

+ I've done some 5 Basic Algorithme



**Things I learned:** 

**CORS**: Cross-origin ressource sharing. The server need to implement CORS if the site sending the request is not on the same domain or port.
To allow CORS on the server, the server must send this headers in the response:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept
```

If the response doesn't contain these headers and the site on another domain or port, the browser will throw a CORS issue.


**fetch()**
fetch is method use to make request.
```
init = {
  method, // GET, POST ....
  headers, 
  mode, // cors, no-cors (if no-cors mode enable Cache-Control, Content-Language,Content-Type,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma can be added to request 
  cache, 
        }
fetch(url,[init]) : Promise<Response>
 


```

## Day 2: January 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

I've done some 5 Basic Algorithme.
I use Array.slice and Array.splice() as I often inverted these methods I'll write a memo.

**Things I learned:**

**Array.prototype.slice()**

The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end **(end not included)**. The original array will not be modified.
``` 
var animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant'];

console.log(animals.slice(2));
// expected output: Array ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

console.log(animals.slice(2, 4));
// expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]

console.log(animals.slice(1, 5));
// expected output: Array ["bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"]
```

**Array.prototype.splice()**

The splice() method **change** the array by removing or adding the elements to the array.
```
var myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'sturgeon'];

myFish.splice(2, 0, 'drum'); // insert 'drum' at 2-index position
// myFish is ["angel", "clown", "drum", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]

myFish.splice(2, 1); // remove 1 item at 2-index position (that is, "drum")
// myFish is ["angel", "clown", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]
```

The exemples for this two methods are from the Mozilla website.


## Day 3: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

I've finish the Basic Algorithme of Freecodecamp.

**Things I learned:**

**arguments of function**
To access the argument of a function use : 
```
function(...){
  const arg1 = arguments[0];
  const arg2 = arguments[1];
}
```
argument is not a array. It's only have the property length.
To transform arguments in a object use :
`const argArray = Array.from(arguments)`

**String.charCodeAt(...)**  
get the charCode of the char

```
const ZcharCode = 'Z'.charCodeAt(0)
```

**String.fromCharCode(...)**
create a string from the charCode



`const A = String.fromCharCode(65)`Â 

**Caesars Cipher**
Shift all alphanumeric char of 13 positions

```
var ZcharCode = 'Z'.charCodeAt(0);
var AcharCode = 'A'.charCodeAt(0);

function shift(charr){
 
  if(charr >=  'A' && charr <= 'Z'){
   
    var charCodeShift = charr.charCodeAt(0) + 13;
    if(charCodeShift > ZcharCode){
      charCodeShift = charCodeShift % ZcharCode + AcharCode -1;
    }
    return String.fromCharCode(charCodeShift);
  }
  return charr;
}

function rot13(str) { // LBH QVQ VG!
 return  str
   .toUpperCase()
   .split('')
   .map(shift)
   .join('');
}

```

**Array.sort(...)**
Sort the array. The default sort order is according to string Unicode code points. So if we want to sort the array of number we need to provide a function to compare the number.

```
function compare(a,b){
  if(a === b){
    return 0
  }
  return a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
```


## Day 3: January 3, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: I have done a major refractor of the cafe-litteraire-front repo

## Day 4: January 4, 2017 
**Today's Progress**:
I try to use ant-design, a UI framework. I wanted to use it for the date and time picker but the css of framework conflict with me css. I find the react-app-rewired to rewrite the config of create-react-app and add other babel plugin. I can use it to add the babel plugin transfrom the graphql file.

## Day 5: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
.
I install the firefox dev edition with ubuntu-make.
Ubuntu make is a command line tool wich allow you to download and install the latest version of popular developer tools.

`umake web firefox-dev`

## Day 5: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

I have done an algorithme to convert number to romain number.
I start my new blog with Gatsby and tackyons.

## Day * : January 16, 2017 

Some SQL katas on codewars.

**Things I learned:**


**Replace in string with postgreSQL**
`regexp_replace(r.address , '\d','!','g') as address` **Do not forget the flag 'g'**


For this challenge you need to create a simple HAVING statement, you want to count how many people have the same age and return the groups with 10 or more people who have that age.
people table schema

  id
  name
  age

return table schema

 age
 total_people

```
SELECT age,
COUNT(id) as total_people
FROM people
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(id) >= 10 /// keep only where COUNT(id) >= 10
```
You are given a table numbers with just one column, number. It holds some numbers that are already ordered.

You need to write a query that makes them un-ordered.

    SELECT *
    FROM numbers
    ORDER BY random();

**Full text search**

For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement. Your task is to create a query and do a FULL TEXT SEARCH. You must search the product table on the field name for the word Awesome and return each row with the given word. Your query MUST contain to_tsvector and to_tsquery PostgreSQL functions.

    SELECT id, name, price from product
    WHERE to_tsvector(name) @@ to_tsquery('Awesome')

**Relational division: Find all movies two actors cast in together**
Best:
    SELECT f.title 
      FROM film f 
      INNER JOIN film_actor a ON f.film_id = a.film_id
      INNER JOIN film_actor b ON f.film_id = b.film_id
      WHERE a.actor_id = 105 AND b.actor_id = 122
      ORDER BY title;

Mine: 

    SELECT film.title FROM
      ((SELECT film_id  FROM film_actor WHERE actor_id = 105) as film_105 INNER JOIN
      (SELECT film_id  FROM film_actor WHERE actor_id = 122) as film_122
      ON film_122.film_id = film_105.film_id)
      INNER JOIN film ON film_105.film_id = film.film_id

**Exemple lateral join**  [link to kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/using-lateral-join-to-get-top-n-per-group/solutions?show-solutions=1)


    SELECT c.category_id,
       c.category,
       p.title,
       p.views,
       p.post_id
    FROM (SELECT c.id AS category_id, c.category FROM categories c ORDER BY c.category) c 
    LEFT JOIN LATERAL
       (SELECT p.title,
               p.views,
               p.id AS post_id
          FROM posts p
         WHERE p.category_id = c.category_id
         ORDER BY p.views DESC, post_id ASC
         LIMIT 2) p ON true;
